## üó∫Ô∏è Project Overview

    <td style="padding: 10px;">Pebble is a platform that allows users to create and track habits, motivating users to complete habits with a unique tracking system. Pebble takes inspiration from the gamified habit tracker Habitica, as well as the Forrest Focus app's tree model, to build a simple yet elegant motivation system for consistant habit completion‚Äî keep your plants alive and grow your garden ! </td>

## üóùÔ∏è Key Features

- **Habits**: Create, edit, and delete habits, including recurring habits that appear only on selected days of the week. 
- **Garden**: 'Plant' a tree for a specific habit! Choose between a number of pre-selected plant types, with varying growth requirements, and 'grow' your tree by completing its associated habit. Beware, though, that neglecting this habit may kill the plant. When fully grown, users may add a plant to their garden, and even sell trees from their garden for Pebbs! 

## üéØ Project Mission

Pebble functions as my solo capstone project for App Academy, pushing me to develop a fully functioning web application front to back with limited external support. The primary goal is to garner experience performing full stack softwate engineer work with fast-paced deadlines. I also aim to provide a meaningful tracking system for my own habit goals, as well as a supportive platform for others trying to get their life together!
